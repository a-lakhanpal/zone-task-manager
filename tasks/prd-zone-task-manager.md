# Product Requirements Document: Home Assistant Zone-Based Task Management System

## Introduction/Overview

The Home Assistant Zone-Based Task Management System is a custom integration that helps homeowners systematically track, schedule, and manage home maintenance tasks across different zones/areas of their property. This feature solves the common problem of forgetting routine maintenance tasks, provides systematic tracking across home areas, and enables coordination of household responsibilities among family members.

The system integrates seamlessly with Home Assistant's existing infrastructure, utilizing defined areas/zones while allowing users to create custom zones for their specific needs.

## Goals

1. **Systematic Task Organization**: Enable users to organize home maintenance tasks by physical zones/areas
2. **Flexible Scheduling**: Provide comprehensive scheduling options (daily, weekly, monthly, custom intervals, specific dates)
3. **Automated Reminders**: Deliver intelligent notification summaries to prevent forgotten tasks
4. **Progress Tracking**: Track task completion history and automatically reschedule recurring tasks
5. **Family Coordination**: Support multiple users managing shared household responsibilities
6. **Data Persistence**: Maintain reliable local data storage with backup/export capabilities
7. **Seamless Integration**: Leverage existing Home Assistant features (areas, notifications, calendar)

## User Stories

**As a homeowner**, I want to organize my home maintenance tasks by room/zone so that I can systematically manage upkeep across my entire property.

**As a busy parent**, I want to receive daily/weekly task summaries via Home Assistant notifications so that I don't forget important maintenance tasks.

**As a family member**, I want to mark tasks as complete and add notes about the work done so that other family members know what was accomplished.

**As a property maintainer**, I want to set flexible recurring schedules for tasks (every 30 days, quarterly, seasonally) so that maintenance happens at appropriate intervals.

**As a user**, I want to add custom zones beyond the standard rooms so that I can track outdoor areas, storage spaces, and other unique areas of my property.

**As a detail-oriented homeowner**, I want to add notes to tasks (like warranty expiration dates, specific instructions) so that I have important context when completing tasks.

**As a Home Assistant user**, I want the system to integrate with my existing areas and notification system so that it feels like a native part of my smart home setup.

## Open Questions

1. **Notification Timing**: What time of day should daily summaries be sent? Should this be user-configurable?
2. **Task Priority System**: Should tasks have priority levels (high, medium, low) or remain simple?
3. **Completion Verification**: Should there be an option to require photos for task completion verification?
4. **Shared Task Assignment**: How should tasks be assigned to specific family members in multi-user households?
5. **Integration Depth**: Should the system create calendar events for each task or just integrate with existing calendar entities?
6. **Task Templates**: Should there be a library of common home maintenance task templates to help users get started?
7. **Overdue Handling**: How should the system handle tasks that are significantly overdue (reschedule vs. keep overdue)?
8. **Zone Inheritance**: Should custom zones be able to inherit properties from Home Assistant areas?
